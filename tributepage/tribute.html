      Silvia Lubich her original name was conceived on 22 January 1922 in Trent, Italy. In 1940's amid World War II, while bombs were
      destroying Trent, Chiara had an effective religious affair,  "more grounded than the bombs that were falling on Trent" which
      Chiara right away imparted to her dearest companions. In the wake of persuading her companions they proclaimed that, should they be
      murdered, they wished to have just a single engraving cut on their tomb: "And we have believed in love".  And its from that day a flame
      of love that began to shine in the midst of the ashes and destruction.
